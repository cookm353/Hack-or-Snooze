# Hack-or-Snooze

## To-Do
1. Add trash cans to left of stories in my stories
2. Create functions to generate ULs for favorites and my stories
    * Functions should when links are clicked in nav bar
    * Should also run any time a story is favorited/unfavorited and created/deleted
    so lists are updated
3. Add event listener so they can be deleted

## Issues
* Each time you click "favorites" on horizontal nav bar the favorites are added again
    * Create functions for making uls for both favorite and own stories


## Tasks Completed and Issues Fixed:
* Updating currentUser when stories are added and removed from favorites
* Displaying host name
